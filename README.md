# 2025_Swerve

This project contains code related to the drive train. We use a swerve drive. This project houses a basic implementation of a drive train which you can pull out and include in a new project that needs a swerve drive train.

## Branches
* main
    * This is the drive train of the TyRapXXIV final Orlando software code updated with addresses and constants
    for the Sparky Junior bot. It is stored here separately to give students a chance to understand the swerve drive code on its own especially for future robot implementations. This code has been verified on the Junior robot. Attempts to use it on another robot will likely need retuning of the swerve drives.
* 2024Swerve_Jake
    * Jake is trying to rebuild the TyRapXXIV swerve drive in his own way.
* 2024Practice
    * Jake is using a test-bed to develop teaching tools for other students.
* 2025_swerve
    * This is the base swerve implemenation for WPILib 2025
